# Practical-Machine-Learning
Course Project for Practical Machine Learning: Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. The goal of this project, is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.
